## 📋 System Overview

This system models the full operational flow of a national railway network — from train registration and station management to journey logging, passenger boarding, ticket cancellations and train maintenance. Every module solves a real railway operations problem and maps to a specific data structure for a justified reason.

## ⚙️ How to Build & Run

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler
- VS Code (recommended) or any terminal

### Compile & Run

**Using Makefile:**
```bash
make          # compile only
make run      # compile and run
make clean    # remove compiled output
```

**Using GCC directly:**
```bash
gcc -Wall -std=c99 -Iinclude main.c src/*.c -o railway_system
./railway_system
```

## 📦 Module Details

### 1. 🚂 Train Fleet Registry — `Array`
Stores all trains in the Sri Lanka Railways fleet in a fixed-capacity array, modelling the real constraint of a national rail network.

**Base Operations:** `addTrain` `removeTrain` `updateTrainInfo` `searchTrain` `displayFleet` `isFleetEmpty` `isFleetFull`

**Sort:** `bubbleSortByCapacity` — sorts trains from highest to lowest seat count

**Extra:** `calculateTotalSeatCapacity` — SUM of all seat counts across the entire fleet array

---

### 2. 🏢 Station Directory — `Singly Linked List`
Dynamically manages all railway stations. Stations are added and removed as the network expands — a linked list grows and shrinks naturally.

**Base Operations:** `addStation` `removeStation` `updateStationInfo` `searchStation` `displayAllStations`

**Sort:** `insertionSortByCode` — sorts stations alphabetically by station code by relinking nodes

**Extra:** `countStationsOnRoute` — FILTERED COUNT of nodes matching a specific routeID

---

### 3. 📋 Journey Log — `Doubly Linked List`
Logs every train journey. Controllers scroll **forward** to see latest journeys and **backward** to investigate past delays. Only a Doubly LL supports both directions natively.

**Base Operations:** `addJourneyRecord` `removeJourneyRecord` `updateJourneyStatus` `searchJourneyRecord` `displayAllJourneys` `traverseForward` `traverseBackward`

**Sort:** `selectionSortByDeparture` — sorts journeys chronologically by departure time

**Extra:** `calculateJourneyDistance` — SUM of distanceKm fields across all journeys for a specific train

---

### 4. 🔄 Train Route Rotation — `Circular Linked List`
Cycles trains through route deployments endlessly. After the last train's trip the rotation loops back to the first — no NULL terminator, just a continuous cycle.

**Base Operations:** `addTrainToRoute` `removeTrainFromRoute` `updateRouteInfo` `searchTrainInRoute` `displayRouteRotation`

**Navigation:** `nextTrainOnRoute` `getCurrentTrain` — the defining operations of a Circular LL

**Extra:** `getRouteSize` — manually COUNT nodes via circular traversal since there is no NULL end point

---

### 5. 🎫 Ticket Cancellation Log — `Stack`
Records every ticket cancellation in LIFO order. If a cancellation was made by mistake, pop it to reinstate the ticket. The top of the stack is always the most recent cancellation.

**Base Operations:** `pushCancellation` `popCancellation` `peekLastCancellation` `searchCancellation` `displayCancellationLog` `clearLog` `isStackEmpty` `isStackFull`

**Extra:** `getTotalRefundAmount` — SUM of all ticketPrice values across every record in the stack

---

### 6. 🧍 Passenger Boarding Queue — `Queue`
Manages passengers waiting to board at the platform. First passenger to join is first to board — strictly FIFO, exactly how real platform boarding works.

**Base Operations:** `enqueuePassenger` `dequeuePassenger` `peekNextPassenger` `searchPassenger` `displayBoardingQueue` `cancelBoarding` `isBoardingQueueEmpty` `isBoardingQueueFull`

**Extra:** `getAverageWaitTime` — AVERAGE position metric and class distribution across all queue slots

---

### 7. 🔧 Train Maintenance Queue — `Queue`
Manages trains waiting for depot servicing in submission order. Ensures no train skips its scheduled maintenance regardless of type or importance.

**Base Operations:** `enqueueForMaintenance` `processNextMaintenance` `peekNextMaintenance` `searchMaintenance` `displayMaintenanceQueue` `cancelMaintenance` `isMaintenanceQueueEmpty` `isMaintenanceQueueFull`

**Extra:** `countByMaintenanceType` — CONDITIONAL COUNT of entries by type: Routine / Repair / Emergency

---

## 🔗 Module Integration

All modules are linked through two universal keys:

```c
trainID    →  assigned in Train Fleet Registry (Module 1)
              used in Journey Log, Route Rotation, Maintenance Queue

stationID  →  assigned in Station Directory (Module 2)
              used in Journey Log, Boarding Queue
```

## 🎯 Extra Function Summary — Why Each Is Valid

| Member | Extra Function | Type | What It Computes |
|--------|---------------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | `calculateTotalSeatCapacity()` | Aggregate SUM | Total seats across entire fleet array |
| 2 | `countStationsOnRoute()` | Filtered COUNT | Stations matching a given routeID |
| 3 | `calculateJourneyDistance()` | Aggregate SUM | Total km travelled by a specific train |
| 4 | `getRouteSize()` | Structural COUNT | Nodes in circular cycle via manual traversal |
| 5 | `getTotalRefundAmount()` | Aggregate SUM | Total refund value of all stack entries |
| 6 | `getAverageWaitTime()` | Aggregate AVERAGE | Queue depth metric and class distribution |
| 7 | `countByMaintenanceType()` | Conditional COUNT | Entries per maintenance type in queue |

> Every extra function is a **computation or aggregate on DS data** — not a search, not a display, not a boundary check.
